# 🐦 Phenix Data Visualizer

That’s how **Phenix Data Visualizer** was born, as a symbol of constant pursuit of sharpening my skills and reassuring myself i can climb from any fall.

Inspired by the **Phenix **—a bird that symbolizes rebirth—I built this project as a **reminder that failure is never the end**. This can take **any API endpoint** and beautifully visualize its data in interactive, editable cards with **one-click exports to JSON, Excel and PDF formats**.
