# 🐦 Phenix Data Visualizer

That’s how **Phenix Data Visualizer** was born, as a symbol of constant pursuit of sharpening my skills and reassuring myself i can climb from any fall.

Inspired by the **Phoenix (Phinix)**—a bird that symbolizes rebirth—I built this project as a **reminder that failure is never the end**. This can take **any API endpoint** and beautifully visualize its data in interactive, editable cards with **one-click exports to JSON, Excel, PDF, and DOC formats**.

## 💡 Why this Project Exists

- To make **data visualization accessible and visually appealing**.
- To remind myself and others: **Falling isn't failure. Not getting up is.**
